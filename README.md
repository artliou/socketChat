Here are some ideas to improve the application:

Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects

Add support for nicknames

Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.

Add “{user} is typing” functionality

Show who’s online

Add private messaging

Share your improvements!
